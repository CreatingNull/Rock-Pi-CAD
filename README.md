# ![NullTek Documentation](resources/NullTekDocumentationLogo.png) Rock Pi CAD

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY%204-blue)](LICENSE.md) 

Just a collection of CAD for Radxa single board computers.
Seems like there is a lack of free models in the community for certain devices, so I figured I'd release mine.

Currently, Includes:

* **Rock Pi S V13**
  * [PCA model](Rock-Pi-S)
  * [Enclosure](Rock-Pi-S/enclosure-simple)
